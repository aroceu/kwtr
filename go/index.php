	<p><em><strong>Four years, seven months since the outbreak. No cure found.</strong></em></p>

	<p>Yui spits, then cringes&mdash;it's half blood from where the inside of her cheek broke on her teeth when she went down.</p>

	<p>It's chaos all around. Gunfire rings out in the distance, but it sounds like they're winning&mdash;they've got to be winning, don't they? They can't <em>lose</em> this. Not everyone together, not in this last ditch effort.</p>

	<p>Her vision sways and tips as she tries to make sure, she picks out columns of smoke against the clear blue sky. The day would be beautiful, if it wasn't the end of the world.</p>

	<p>A hand closes down across her mouth and the blood inside comes across all copper. </p>

	<p>"There are three behind us," Kiyoko whispers. She looks amazing amongst the dying world, calm and collected, as she picks through what needs to be done and does it. Nothing like Yui, perpetually on the brink of tears. But Yui puts her old captain face on and holds them in; it's just that there's a lot more to hold in and no time to break down in the bathroom.</p>

	<p>She nods under her hand and Kiyoko glances over her shoulder. Yui watches as her eyes widen, and she leans in close, close enough that her lips brush Yui's ear. "Clicker."</p>

	<p>Yui's eyes water as Kiyoko removes her hand. After Kiyoko said it, she hears it, too, the <em>clickclickclickclickclick</em> of the clicker finding its way, the fungus that makes up its head will be swinging back and forth, searching for them, listening for the sound of their breathing, the sound of their teeth clenching together, the shift of their clothing. <em>Everything</em>.</p>

	<p>Yui holds her breath, digs her nails into the palm of one hand and tightens her grip on her shiv with the other. Kiyoko slips off back and around&mdash;she's more dangerous than anyone. After a beat, Yui follows. It's a system they created to reduce noise, but every time Kiyoko's out of her sight, even for just the ten seconds they measure by, Yui thinks that she's going to be left alone forever and her heartbeat will give them away despite all their efforts.</p>

	<p>She spots Kiyoko's back as she rises up to slice through an artery in the clicker's neck. Yui can still hear its clicking even after it falls silent, like a phantom that never leaves.</p>

	<p>Most of the time, clickers stick to the shadows, dwell in basements with water running down the walls, waiting for something to come to them. But this eradication has them out in force. It has everyone out in force: civilians trying to get by, with the defence&mdash;for all the good they do&mdash;infected. Enough to make even the daylight thick with spores.</p>

	<p>She pulls on her gas mask and blinks away tears that she can't have.</p>

	<p>People are dying today. Yui wants to cry for every one of them.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Two years, three months since the outbreak. No cure found. </strong></em></p><p>"Where did you find these?" Yui asks, a smile as wide as her face lighting up her eyes, something that happens all too rarely now.</p><p>Kiyoko slips the ratty plastic bags into Yui's hands and sits next to her, up against her side, one hand tucked behind Yui's back. She needs the contact. Yui doesn't ask, if Kiyoko ever slips and kisses her, she certainly might.</p><p>"I paid a visit to the orchards," Kiyoko replies. She takes one of the cherries from inside the bag, and pops it into her mouth.</p><p>Yui stiffens. "Oh."</p><p>The dusty house feels more safe than it is. Soft light filters in through its net curtains and the doors are all still intact: it makes a perfect getaway for two girls trying to get by. Kiyoko isn't sure that they can call themselves girls anymore; they're too old for the schools and too proficient with weapons to call themselves anything that suggests innocence.</p><p>"You know, none of the kids would get these. They would go right into the bellies of the authorities instead," Kiyoko explains, hoping her distaste comes through.</p><p>Yui's hand hovers over the bag. But, eventually, she dips her fingers in, takes out one of the dark purple berries. "We should give some to them. The kids." </p><p>Kiyoko smiles at her gentleness. </p><p>Yui bites into her cherry and has to cover her mouth as she all but moans over the taste. When she swallows, a trickle of juice slips over the corner of her lip. Kiyoko wipes it off with her thumb, then sucks the transferred juice off. She breathes in deep to keep her composure steady as she realises how stupid that was.</p><p><em>I may as well just kiss her, now</em>, she thinks.</p><p>But Yui takes initiative from her, and presses their lips together.</p>

	<p><strong><em>Two years since the outbreak. No cure found.</em></strong></p><p>It's much too fast, and doesn't feel real, and too clumsy for Kiyoko's liking, but she smashes their mouths and twists her fingers at the hem of Yui's shirt anyway. Yui's making noises into her, like she's not thinking too much about this either, and Kiyoko doesn't want to think about it, think about anything at all, except <em>feeling</em>, and Yui, and&mdash;</p><p>"Kiyoko," Yui blabbers against her, and it's one of the first times, one of the only times Kiyoko's ever heard her say her name. Kiyoko makes sure to remember like when the last hands that touch her aren't soft like the ones on her now, warm, fumbling, burning for something more than life <em>and</em> death.</p><p>Kiyoko stays silent, but her glasses bump against both their noses. Yui giggles and pulls her face away, delicately placing them on the table at the side; Kiyoko's hands are working at the zip of Yui's jeans. They're in an old office building, the kind of place Kiyoko's dad used to work in, which is free of spores&mdash;the important part. </p><p>"Oh," Yui breathes, when Kiyoko gets her jeans open, and Kiyoko tilts her head up to Yui.</p><p>"Oh," she echoes, letting her breath cascade across Yui's face. Yui tenses in a way that she arches towards Kiyoko's fingers, which are dancing on the skin between her hip and her belly. </p><p>"I&mdash;" Yui starts, but Kiyoko pushes her quiet to kiss Yui's jaw, mouth at it rhythmically. That does get Yui quiet, in a way where Kiyoko can feel the guttural noises against her neck, lets her fingers drift further down south.</p><p>Yui's breath hitches. "I-I'm not sure&mdash;" she's trying to get out, and Kiyoko knows what she's going to say. She continues kissing her, anyway. They've been in worse positions together when infected have found them, but everything's about reducing risk. And this keeps her sane.</p><p>Kiyoko drops down when Yui goes silent again, and tugs at the waistband of Yui's jeans, bringing her underwear down with them. Yui's eyes are dark as she watches, but Kiyoko grazes the back of her knuckles against the hair there. Yui's knees tremble.</p><p>"Kiyoko," she says again, and Kiyoko wishes she hadn't broken her music player on some of the first days, so she can record Yui and play the sound of her name over and over again. Kiyoko sucks a finger into her mouth, staring at Yui, mouth watering. </p><p>She pops her finger back out.</p><p>"Is this really a good ti&mdash;<em>ah</em>!" Yui's voice cracks, her eyelids fluttering and lower lip catching between her teeth when Kiyoko hooks her fingers inside of her. Kiyoko presses a kiss to her clit, then replaces her lips with her thumb, working around it in small circles.</p><p>She inches her kisses down Yui's thigh and fucks her with her fingers, drawing out the sounds that she loves.</p>

	<p><em><strong>One year, eleven months since the outbreak. No cure found.</strong></em></p><p>Yui couldn't keep the way her hands kept shaking from being visible, not the way she wanted to. </p><p>Not after that. </p><p>She steals a glance towards Kiyoko; they're standing apart, even though she desperately wants to reach out and grab onto her hand, grab onto something <em>living</em>, some reminder that not everything in this world is the cloying smell of death, short shallow breaths through masks, and the heartache of having hope after hope dashed. But Kiyoko is standing a step away, so far away, her back ramrod straight. She, like Yui had been, is staring at the building that was once their high school, the fungi covering it making it clear that the rumors that there had been a pocket of clarity in Sendai, that some were still clean are just that. She feels almost hollow, looking up the slope and knowing that nothing moving inside resembles the friends she once knew, but the longer they stand here, the greater risk they pose.</p><p>Distantly, Yui can feel the edges of her nails, ragged&mdash;her hands were made to fight on a court, not in the apocalypse&mdash;dig sharply into the palm of her hand, but she can't take her eyes off of Kiyoko, still staring, unmoving.</p><p>"We&mdash;," she starts, because they really should go. </p><p>Her words might as well have been a bullet, for how sharply the sound rips through Kiyoko. Yui's feet start moving almost before Kiyoko's knees hit the ground, one hand hovering over her shoulder as Kiyoko buries her head in her hands. </p><p>"It's not fair!" One hand punches the ground with almost as much force as her words. "They&mdash;... It shouldn't&mdash;... We&mdash;..." The sobs are loud, racking, and Yui knows they should be quiet, but she can't bring herself to do anything but wrap an arm around Kiyoko's shoulder, the other hand going to cover the one on the ground.</p><p>She presses her forehead to Kiyoko's, lightly, trying simply to breathe evenly and swallow down her own tears. Each sob echoes through her as if it were her own, but instead she leans up and kisses Kiyoko's brow. Her lips curve slightly, even as her eyes squeeze shut, but the illusion of comfort is more important right now. Moving forward is more important, maybe more than ever. They can't give up now.</p><p>They stay that way for too long, but nothing disturbs them. Eventually, Yui uncurls from Kiyoko and rises to her feet, extending a hand down. Kiyoko takes it, exhaling deeply as she rises&mdash;a pillar once more&mdash;and one hand wipes away the tears cutting through the grime on her face. Her eyes are still red behind her glasses, but Yui just squeezes their joined hands once before they move on, and if Kiyoko doesn't let go, she doesn't say anything about it.</p>

	<p><strong><em>Three years, ten months since the outbreak. No cure found.</em></strong></p><p>Kiyoko's words stick in her throat as she watches Yui haphazardly shove her things into the black Karasuno sports bag she's managed to hold onto after all this time. Yui shoots her a look that Kiyoko doesn't know how to read, though clearly she's expected to say something in reply.</p><p>She can barely hear herself think. </p><p>"Will you come back?" she asks, because it seems like the thing to do.</p><p>Yui snorts, and brushes away an angry tear. "Will it bother you if I don't?" </p><p>"Yes," she says, putting all the feeling she can into the word. She doesn't know how much feeling <em>all she can</em> is. "Of course it would." She holds back from adding: <em>I love you</em> because she's not sure of it. Not with everything around them as it is and their lives how they are. Who could bear to love anybody while the world slowly crumbles?</p><p>The last of her clothes disappear into her bag and Yui jams the zip as she tugs it closed. She swears and brushes away more tears. "How do you do it?" she asks, hands clenched in the fabric of the bag. She waits angrily for an answer.</p><p>There isn't one Kiyoko is happy giving. She isn't entirely sure what Yui is asking her in the first place. "I keep going." It's all anyone can do, these days.</p><p>The zip crunches but locks together when Yui forces the last gap closed. "I don't want to keep going." She sounds hollow, and Kiyoko can't remember the last time she slapped her cheeks, and pushed on with determination like she used to.</p><p>Kiyoko's nails dig into the palms of her hands. She needs to trim them but their scissors are getting blunt and she can't remember how to sharpen them properly any more. She knows she'll have to chew them off, but she doesn't want to. She doesn't want to lose the part of herself that doesn't chew on her nails. The same part that lost not showering in cold water baths and not shooting things that were once alive to save herself and Yui.</p><p>"I'll be heading west, next month," Kiyoko says.</p><p>"Okay," Yui replies.</p><p>"Please find me." Her voice is not her own; it's clogged with tears. They're trickling down her face as well, even though she would swear she isn't crying. She never cries. She keeps things together. She <em>keeps going</em>.</p><p>Yui stalls, shuffling with the zip again. "I can&mdash;" she swallows, blinks away her own tears. "I can stay one more night. But I just, I can't be here any more."</p><p>Kiyoko nods immediately. She understands, and she'll take the extra night. She wants to go with Yui so badly to wherever she is planning to go, but she needs to be here instead. There's supposed to be something important happening. Organizations with people who can help are coming to find them at last. They are coming from the few areas free of spores and infected, and the smell of death that never scrubs off. She'll take having Yui with her, to keep the smell away with someone living, for one more night.</p><p>But, when morning comes, Yui's things are back in their places. Her eyes are red but she smiles again, then asks what needs to be done.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Zero months since the outbreak. No cure found.</strong></em> </p><p>Yui can't handle this, not for a second longer. Her legs don't support her properly as she stands and she has to cling to the edge of the railing that leads up and out of the basement but she manages somehow. She moves one foot in front of the other until she's squeezing her eyes shut to shield them from the light and only opening them in fractions as she pokes her head around the door and into an empty place that doesn't feel like her home any more.</p><p>Her dad always kept plenty of supplies down there, in the basement. It was everything she'd needed when she'd had to find somewhere safe to go after crawling up onto the roof in fear and seeing spores drifting through the air. She had watched them land inside her family, her friends, and take over their brains, destroying their minds and turning them into something inhuman and intent on <em>living</em> by consuming her.</p><p>She'd thrown up over the edge of the roof, waited until nightfall, then crept down into the basement. The foul mouth taste from her vomit stayed for days. No matter how much she rinsed her mouth and spat, it lingered on.</p><p>Living for two weeks on canned food and bottled water in the dark wasn't pleasant, but she did it. She'd rationed everything, used the torch only when she had to, and never went close to the door. Her hands might shake and she might have started laughing to herself to fill the silence when she wasn't sleeping, but she's only doing what needs to be done to keep herself alive. </p><p>Today though, she needed to move.</p><p>Her energy leaves her and she drops to the ground. This is too hard. Too hard and too much. Everyone is dead, she doesn't want to be all alone. </p><p>She drags in a breath. It's ragged and scraping, but it's a start.</p><p>Rain patters outside, which she supposes will mean that the spores she heard about on the radio before she ran out of battery will have settled, and she won't have to worry about becoming a slave to the fungus.</p><p>When she closes her eyes, she can still see her mother's bubbling skin where the spores bloomed and burst through to the surface as she tears into the flesh of her father.</p><p>A <em>tap tap</em> sounds throughout the house, and it takes a moment for Yui to orient herself and track it back to the front door.</p><p><em>Who knocks in the apocalypse?</em> she wonders. <em>Who knocks </em>in the rain<em>, in the apocalypse?</em></p><p>She moves as quietly as she can as she gets to her feet and inches her way along the wall to the door. She turns the latch and can see the dark figure behind the door startle at the soft <em>click</em> that it makes.</p><p>Of all people, it's Kiyoko, holding a clipboard and wearing an orange vest. She'd look just like any other official if it weren't for the shotgun on her hip and the baseball bat sticking out of the backpack on her back.</p><p>"You're alive," slips out from between Kiyoko's lips. She steps forward and pulls Yui into the tightest hug of her life. Kiyoko's shoulder shake, once.</p>

	<p><em><strong>Six years since the outbreak. Cure located. Unprocessed.</strong></em></p><p>"Let me see her." </p><p>Iron strengthens Yui's bones today. She's not stepping out of the hospital until she gets to Kiyoko: they've been together for far too long, they've protected each other for far too long for her to step away now. </p><p>Kiyoko stopped wearing her mask months and months ago and Yui hadn't questioned it, she'd just thought Kiyoko had decided she wanted a way out. Yui might have even been able to finish her herself if she became infected, if she had one last moment with her. But the spores never took, and one night when Yui slipped her underwear down, she'd seen a ring of teeth marks, fully scarred and white against the copper of the rest of her skin. Yui had swallowed and carried on, because Kiyoko always knows what she's doing.</p><p>Then last week, they'd snuck into one of the government camps and been caught by the sweepers. Kiyoko set off all kinds of alarms, though she remained calm&mdash;she's always so calm&mdash;and talked her way out of it. She'd talked her way right into the hospital.</p><p>"I'm her&mdash;" Yui says to the guard. He barely casts a glance her way, so she stops before she can finish the sentence. She swallows and tries again. "I'll do anything."</p><p>He casts a glance with a frown at that. "What's your bag say?"</p><p>She scrambles to pull it around, show him where Karasuno is written on the side.</p><p>He swears. "You're from home." He grits his teeth and she settles her bag back over her hip, trying not to let her hopes rise.</p><p>He's her age, she can tell now, though his uniform makes him look older. He shifts his weight from side to side, keeping his grip loose on his weapon&mdash;no one ever goes empty handed these days. "Look," he shifts again, glancing over his shoulder. "I can't let you in, they'd have my neck. There's something big going on and I'm not one to question the higher-ups. But," he casts another glance left and right, making him stand out more to anyone who's watching, no doubt, "there's a broken window above a dumpster around to the north, keep meaning to fix it but..." he shrugs. They both know no one has time for fixing things these days.</p><p>She ducks her head, says her thanks with as much of a smile as she can muster. </p><p>He calls after her as she rounds the corner of the building, "You didn't hear it from me, alright?"</p><p>Scrambling in doesn't take much work. All she has to do is shift a chair up, and wedge it back against the broken glass. They should really get on and fix that soon.</p><p>The inside of the hospital is eerie. Yui passes doors slapped with caution tape that she doesn't bother to enter, and overturned carts lying on their sides, their wheels in the air and bottles and syringes scattered on the floor. </p><p>It doesn't take long to find where Kiyoko is: only the second floor has lights on after all, and then it's a matter of sneaking until she can hear voices. Someone's yelling, and she catches a soft snatch of Kiyoko's voice.</p><p>She zeros in on it, shifting until she's right behind the wall to the room.</p><p>"I should get a say in what to do with my life."</p><p>Someone loud and male barks a laugh. "It's not your life, little lady, not with what you have."</p><p>Yui can hear a muscle in Kiyoko's jaw tighten, even if she can't see it move. "From what I understand, you don't know <em>what</em> I have. And if you can't guarantee my head will help you in your efforts, it will stay attached to my neck."</p><p>Someone stands and Yui shifts out of the way of the door as Kiyoko exits the room.</p><p>She has a knife pressed to her throat with her own hand.</p><p>Yui waves, keeping silent in case Kiyoko doesn't want to talk. She blinks, grabs Yui's hand mid-wave and threads their fingers together with her knife-free hand. She leans in, whispers, "Quickly," into Yui's ear, making her blood run cold.</p><p>It's only seconds before they hear footsteps behind them. Kiyoko yanks her into a run just as Yui feels a prick through to her shoulder and then numbness radiating through her veins. She can't even get her fingers over the dart to pull it out.</p><p>Kiyoko yells then, and it's the last thing Yui hears before she succumbs to unconsciousness.</p><p><p style="text-align:center;">*</p></p><p>Sleep takes its time in fading as Yui comes to, and she keeps her eyes shut through it, scared for what she might see when she opens them. That was bad, that was <em>dangerous</em>. They wanted Kiyoko's head. The only reason they didn't get it was because Kiyoko was holding a knife to her throat and ready to ruin the thing they wanted so badly.</p><p>A warm hand sweeps her hair to the side&mdash;Yui's eyes snap open to the bright blue sky and Kiyoko's smiling mouth. A cut curves over her cheekbone but it's not stopping that small smile.</p><p>"I love you," says Kiyoko, and it's the first time Yui's ever heard those words in that way. "I couldn't let you go."</p><p>"I love you, too," says Yui, then adds, "I'm glad you kept your head," even though she doesn't want to think about how many corpses that will create.</p>
